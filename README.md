# IoT-Lighting-for-Events
Everyone wants a unique and amazing d√©cor for their event. As an IoT mentee, how do you take advantage of such opportunities? Here is a simple guide.
# Simple steps
Meet your client
Identify a theme together with your client and see the venue.
Sketch out the theme according to the venue on a pen and paper, 
That the different measurements of the venue as this will help guide you on how much it will cost you to buy the necessary materials you need and the lights from the market (In Juba, Dubai stores have most of the lights).
Work on your budget and present it to your client. When she/he approves, meet your team and present it to them.
Distribute tasks among your selves.

# Setting up the venue
Take out your pen and paper to check out the different Measurements depending on the material.
# For example, for the IoT Halloween Party,
# For the Witch hats;
Takes 13cms as the measurement for each piece of clothe so that you can be able to cut it in asquare form.
Make sure all sides are equal.
fold it in a triangular format and the sow one side to form a hat.
Cut the tip of the cut so that you can be able to put a LED Light inside it and then sow it again.
Repeat that for all the other pieces to make several witch hats.

# LED Lights
Normally, the chrismas Led Lights keep glowing depending on how they have been programmed from the manufacturer.
Depending on what the Client wnats, hack into those lights and build your own circuit to control this lights according to what your clients wants (Python and Arduino programming).
And you will have the lights do the magic for your event.

# Backdrops
For cases, where you need a backdrop of stars, sow the hacked light on a black light picture of clothe to illluminate the stars to bring the dreamy feel to your event.
